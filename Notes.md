TODO :
- [ ] it is useful to become familiar with the risk and return characteristics of some of the securities we have discussed.

Return
- Return on an investment over a particular span of time called *holding period* *return*
- Sum of change in market price + income received over the holding period divided by the price in the beginning.
	- Bought for 100\$, paid dividends for 5\$ and had a market price of 105\$ at the end of the year $\frac{5 + 5}{100} = 10\%$  

Factor that can affect risk
- The maturity of an instrument (Long = risky)
- The risk characteristic and creditworthiness of the issuer or guarantor of the investment
- The nature and priority of the claims the investment has on income and assets
- The liquidity of the instrument and the type of market in which it is traded

**Length of Time an Order Is Outstanding**
- For non-market orders an investor must specify how long the order should be outstanding.
- If nothing is specified a 1-day interval will be assumed.

**Margin**
- Investors can buy securities either with cash or with part cash and part borrowing. If the investor utilizes borrowing as well as cash, the investor is said to purchase the securities on margin.

$$ \texttt{Margin} = \frac{\texttt{Market value of assets - Amount borrowed}}{\texttt{Market value of assets}} $$

- If the margin falls below the Maintenance market, and the investor doesn't take action (ex. by adding cash or securities). The brokerage firm can sell the investor securities to increases the margin.
